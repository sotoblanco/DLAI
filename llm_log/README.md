In this folder you can find the logs of the LLMs used to generate the code and the situation for the assignments.

- **situation_log.txt**: Log of the situation for the assignment, this means a real-world situation for the learner engage into the assignment and prepare the next assignment and next steps in the course to follow their learning process. 

- **code_log.txt**: Log of the code for the assignment, I defined everything on what I need in the function to be present and the critical parts for the training loop and asked the specific PyTorch code to be present in the response.

- **testing_log.txt**: Log of the testing for the assignment, which is the unit test for the code, specifiying the expected output and the actual output and what I need to be evaluated.

My usual approach with LLMs tools is to ask to different LLMs and create a solution based on aggregating response and manually change the code to make it work in case it is needed. 

In this approach the situation set-up and the code was the smothest part, the testing did required manual work that might not be capture in the logs as I took the response and change according to the needs of this assignment.
